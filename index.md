# Professional Journey

###  Software Engineer â€” Vervee Couture, Bangalore, India  
May 2022 â€“ July 2024

At Vervee Couture, I had the opportunity to work at the crossroads of technology, creativity, and customer experience.  
I led the design and development of a microservices-based e-commerce platform using React and AWS, which boosted user engagement by 30% and improved system response times by 25%.

Beyond feature development, I took a deep dive into cloud architecture - building a resilient backend with AWS EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, and RDS to ensure 99.9% uptime even during peak seasons.  
I also engineered CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Docker, streamlining deployments and reducing release cycles by 40%.

Security was never an afterthought: I implemented AES encryption, **OAuth 2.0 authentication, and helped integrate a reliable payment system, ensuring customer trust remained rock solid.

This experience sharpened my ability to build systems that not only perform at scale â€” but are also designed with user trust and long-term reliability at the core.

---

###  IT Support Analyst â€” University of Cincinnati, Library IT Services, Cincinnati, OH  
September 2024 â€“ Present

Currently, I am part of the IT Services team at the University of Cincinnati, working to improve digital experiences for students and faculty.

Here, I develop Flask-based web applications that have reduced resource access times by 40%, making academic research faster and more efficient.  
I also focus heavily on backend optimization â€” tuning relational database queries to enhance system performance.

Alongside development, I provide technical support, ensuring that technology never becomes a barrier to learning.  
This role has strengthened my skills in user-centric design, quick problem-solving, and efficient backend engineering.
