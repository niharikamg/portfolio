# About Me

Hello and Welcome! I'm Niharika - a Software Engineer passionate about building secure, scalable, and intelligent systems.

If you're curious about how cloud computing, AI security, and full-stack development come together to solve real-world challenges, you're in the right place. My work lives at this intersection, blending innovation with reliability to create systems that perform under pressure and scale with confidence.

Over the years, I've designed and deployed cloud-native applications on AWS and Azure, architected microservices platforms, built AI-driven tools, and optimized application performance using Kubernetes and Docker ecosystems. Every project has taught me something new, and fueled my drive to build smarter, more resilient solutions.

I believe technology should not just be powerful, but also accessible, secure, and impactful.  
Whether it's enabling faster data insights, building secure AI models, or designing systems that can grow effortlessly - I'm always focused on delivering outcomes that matter.

Feel free to explore my portfolio below. I hope it gives you a glimpse into my passion for solving complex problems and building meaningful technology!

# Professional Journey

###  Software Engineer — Vervee Couture, Bangalore, India  
May 2022 – July 2024

At Vervee Couture, I had the opportunity to work at the crossroads of technology, creativity, and customer experience.  
I led the design and development of a microservices-based e-commerce platform using React and AWS, which boosted user engagement by 30% and improved system response times by 25%.

Beyond feature development, I took a deep dive into cloud architecture - building a resilient backend with AWS EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, and RDS to ensure 99.9% uptime even during peak seasons.  
I also engineered CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Docker, streamlining deployments and reducing release cycles by 40%.

Security was never an afterthought: I implemented AES encryption, **OAuth 2.0 authentication, and helped integrate a reliable payment system, ensuring customer trust remained rock solid.

This experience sharpened my ability to build systems that not only perform at scale — but are also designed with user trust and long-term reliability at the core.

###  IT Support Analyst — University of Cincinnati, Library IT Services, Cincinnati, OH  
September 2024 – Present

Currently, I am part of the IT Services team at the University of Cincinnati, working to improve digital experiences for students and faculty.

Here, I develop Flask-based web applications that have reduced resource access times by 40%, making academic research faster and more efficient.  
I also focus heavily on backend optimization — tuning relational database queries to enhance system performance.

Alongside development, I provide technical support, ensuring that technology never becomes a barrier to learning.  
This role has strengthened my skills in user-centric design, quick problem-solving, and efficient backend engineering.
